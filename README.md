# Multi-Label Deep Learning — Pneumonia & Pleural Effusion Detection

A multi-label chest X-ray classification model built with **DenseNet121** and trained on the **CheXpert** dataset to simultaneously detect **Pneumonia** and **Pleural Effusion** from frontal chest radiographs.

---

## Project Overview

This project tackles a **multi-label binary classification** problem where each chest X-ray can be positive for one or both conditions at the same time:

| Label              | Description                         |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| `Pneumonia`        | Lung infection causing inflammation |
| `Pleural Effusion` | Fluid buildup around the lungs      |

---

## Dataset

- **Source:** [CheXpert (Stanford)](https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/competitions/chexpert/) — `CheXpert-v1.0-small`
- **Images used:** Frontal views only
- **Split:** 95% training / 5% validation (stratified by label combination)
- **Uncertain labels (`-1`) handling:**
  - Pneumonia `-1` → `1` (treated as positive)
  - Pleural Effusion `-1` → `0` (treated as negative)

---

## Model Architecture

- **Backbone:** `DenseNet121` (pretrained on ImageNet)
- **Output:** 2 neurons with `Sigmoid` activation (one per label)
- **Loss:** `BCEWithLogitsLoss` with label smoothing (`0.9 / 0.05`)
- **Optimizer:** Adam
- **Scheduler:** `ReduceLROnPlateau`
- **Mixed Precision:** `torch.cuda.amp` (faster training on GPU)

## Evaluation Metrics

| Metric       | Description                                                  |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **AUROC**    | Area Under the ROC Curve (per label)                         |
| **F1 Score** | With tuned thresholds: `0.25` (Pneumonia), `0.45` (Effusion) |

## Explainability — GradCAM

The project includes a custom **GradCAM** implementation targeting `DenseNet121`'s `denseblock4` layer, generating heatmaps that highlight the regions of the X-ray that influenced each prediction.

## Requirements

```bash
pip install torch torchvision
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
pip install tqdm opencv-python Pillow
```

Or run directly on **Kaggle** with GPU enabled (recommended).

---

## How to Run

1. Download the [CheXpert-v1.0-small dataset](https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/competitions/chexpert/) and place it under `/kaggle/input/datasets/ashery/chexpert/`
2. Open `multi-label-dl-pneumonia-effusion.ipynb`
3. Run all cells in order
4. Model checkpoints will be saved to `/kaggle/working/checkpoints/`
